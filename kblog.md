Blogs are magical: they help you to look back, not just recalling dots from the past, but also enlighting your paths. They serve as both a mirror and a map, reflecting who you are while navigating you to a new destination. The act of writing a blog post isn't just about jotting down thoughts or sharing information; it's an exercise in clarity, a way to make sense of your ideas, and a reassess of different phases of your life.
